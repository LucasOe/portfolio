					<p className="sm:pr-6">
						My name is Lucas Oelker and I&apos;m a software developer currently studying Visual Computing
						and Design in Lippstadt, Germany. Programming, rendering or web design â€” if it requires a
						computer and some creative thinking I&apos;m interested!
					</p>
					<p className="sm:pr-6">
						I have a deep passion for programming and I like solving problems. I first started learning Java
						and the basics of web development in high school. Today I&apos;m studying Visual Computing and
						Design, which allows me to think about the integrated approach to the conception and development
						of technical systems as well as their conceptual and design perspective.
